There is still a potential problem here. Suppose that getting to the REQUIRED-LENGTH requires adding an odd number

Alternately, suppose that the input is too long, and the TRUNCATE restart is chosen. If the input is one byte longer

a condition is raised every time an (EVAL ...) type is encountered,
with restarts available to tell the macro whether a bitstream is
required for that particular field. 

Typically, the error would reach EMACS, and the programmer can then
pick a restart from the menu.

However, this doesn't work if you're using COMPILE-FILE, because COMPILE-FILE
catches exceptions, so you don't see the error until it has already been
caught, so you will not be presented with the restarts that I have set up.

For most programs, just ignoring the issue is good enough. Setting this to T (the default)
causes the expander to ignore this problem and not raise a condition.")

This is the shittiest implementation ever. It functionally rebuilds the entire

There are several reasons for this. First, the tag system can tolerate a
direct SETF of *QUEUED-POINTERS*, but it cannot tolerate mutation of the
underlying data structure. That is because I'm attempting to rely on the
way special variables work in multithreaded Lisps as a source of thread
safety. Mutating *QUEUED-POINTERS* with RPLACA or RPLACD could be seen
in another thread, but rebuilding the list and SETFing it will not affect
other threads.

FIXME: This approach doesn't provide thread safety unless every
thread binds *QUEUED-POINTERS* with a LET or LAMBDA form. The
WRITE-BINARY method can't do this because it must be able to
push items onto the tag that can be seen by other implementations
of WRITE-BINARY that might have the corresponding DUMP-TAG call."

;; One difficult thing to do is handle offsets within files. Some
;; file formats specify entire tables of offsets in the middle of
;; a structure. It is desireable to be able to resolve these offsets
;; into the objects they point to, and then convert them back into
;; offsets when the object is written back to disk.
;;
;; But the offsets have a base-pointer, which can be some completely
;; arbitrary value, but is often either:
;;
;;  The beginning of the file.
;;
;;  The beginning or end of a structure header.
;;
;;  The beginning or end of the offset itself.
;;
;;  The beginning of some arbitrary field in the structure.
;;
;; In the latter two cases, we can't just go ahead and read the pointer,
;; because the base-pointer isn't known until the entire header or even
;; a large portion of the file has been read.
;;
;; This can be solved by waiting until the entire header is read,
;; and only then converting the offsets into the data they point to.
;; This requires a placeholder to be put in the slot representing
;; the offset. This placeholder serves two functions: First, it
;; contains the actual offset that was read from the file.
;; Second, it remembers the type of object that is to be read.
;;
;; The macroexpander must remember the name of each field that is expected
;; to contain such a placeholder, and insert code to read the pointer and
;; replace the field. 
;;
;; The other problem is more difficult: An offset can be part of
;; a substructure embedded in a larger header, and so will be read
;; in a recursive call to READ-BINARY. The entire header
;; isn't read until the *top* level instance of `read-binary'
;; is done reading data. Therefore, `read-binary' must be given
;; an option to tell it not to resolve pointers, which must
;; be propagated recursively, so that recursive calls to READ-BINARY
;; do not attempt to resolve the offsets they encounter. This could
;; probably be handled with a special variable.
;;
;; Worse yet, an offset found in a structure can have a base
;; pointer relative to a field in a substructure.
;;
;; Even more difficult is writing offsets back to disk. Again,
;; writing of pointers cannot begin until the entire header
;; has been written to disk. That means that every time we
;; encounter a field that must be written as an offset, we
;; must remember the offset *of the offset*, and come back to
;; it when the address is known, which happens after the
;; header has been written. In the meantime, the offset must
;; be written as zero, or another nonce value. This calls for
;; yet another special variable, which stores a map of Lisp objects
;; waiting to be written to disk to the offsets of the offsets
;; that will point to them.
;;
;; Every time a value that is to be written as an offset is encountered,
;; a cons `(,object . ,(file-position)) is pushed onto the table. When
;; the toplevel READ-BINARY is reached, it pops each object, appends
;; it to the file, and writes its base-pointer-corrected offset to the
;; stored file-position.
;;
;; The only question is what to do if the file is divided into sections,
;; each with its own type of data.

A Virtual Type is a rule that tells the LISP-BINARY how to read a particular kind of
value from a stream, and how to write it back. The result of reading a Virtually-Typed object
can be an object of any Lisp type. Which Lisp type the Virtual Type corresponds to must
be specified in the LISP-TYPE argument.

The same LISP-TYPE can be produced by many different Virtual Types. As a result, the LISP-BINARY
library must always be told which type it is reading or writing. This is usually done at compile-time
through the DEFBINARY macro.

The READER and WRITER must be functions.

The READER accepts a STREAM argument and returns two values:

   1. The fully-processed value that was read.
   2. The number of bytes that were read from the STREAM. If the STREAM is a BIT-STREAM,
      then the number of bytes can be fractional, to indicate how much was read down to
      the bit. 1/8 of a byte = 1 bit.

The WRITER accepts the lambda list (OBJ STREAM), where OBJ is the value to be written. It
returns the number of bytes that were written.

     2. A READER-FORM that can be spliced into another function to read a datum of the specified

        a readable stream. The name of this stream must be stored in (SLOT-VALUE TYPE-INFO 'STREAM-SYMBOL).

     3. A WRITER-FORM to write such a datum. It can be spliced into a scope similar to that of the READER-FORM.

TYPE-INFO is a DEFBINARY-TYPE that contains the following:

   NAME       - The name of the variable to be defined. The WRITER-FORM will be evaluated in a context
                where the NAME is bound to the object being written.
   TYPE       - The type specifier. Its value may specify a virtual type, such as (COUNTED-STRING 1) that this
                function will expand into something else.

   BYTE-ORDER - :LITTLE-ENDIAN or :BIG-ENDIAN.
   TERMINATOR - A SIMPLE-ARRAY that will be matched against the input to determine the end of a string.
                If the TYPE is itself a SIMPLE-ARRAY, TERMINATOR can be a function, which will be passed
                each element read. (TODO: Actually implement that function part)
   READER     - A user-specified function that overrides the reader that this function would otherwise
                generate.
   WRITER     - A user-specified writer function that overrides the default writer.
   STREAM-SYMBOL - The name that will be given to the input and output stream.

   PREVIOUS-DEFS-SYMBOL - A symbol that will be bound to a list of LET bindings at runtime. In the event of
                          an EVAL type, code is generated that will splice the LET bindings found here
                          into a runtime-constructed LET form that will then be EVAL'd.
   BYTE-COUNT-NAME      - The name of the variable that will be bound to the number of bytes read or written so far.
   ALIGN                - The alignment boundary
   ELEMENT-ALIGN        - The alignment boundary for individual elements in an array.
   BIND-INDEX-TO        - In array reads and writes, may specify a variable to bind the loop index to.
                          Or it can be NIL.

			       ;;        a predicate instead of the length of the
			       ;;        buffer. The problem is there's no good

			       ;;        terminated case instead of the fixed-length
			       ;;        case.
			       ;;
			       ;;  It would also be useful if this code could have a
			       ;;  third case in which it somehow produced a lazy
			       ;;  sequence instead of an array. Specifically, this
			       ;;  would be applicable to cases where data should
			       ;;  be handled in a streaming manner. Then, client
			       ;;  code would only need to force each next element
			       ;;  when needed, and it would be read at that time.
			       ;;
			       ;;  Ideally, the decision about whether to read in
			       ;;  a streaming fashion or all at once could be made
			       ;;  at runtime. That would require a totally different
			       ;;  expansion here.
			       ;;
			       ;; NOTE: Do not use CLAZY to implement lazy lists.
			       ;;       This library is incredibly SLOW! Perhaps
			       ;;       this is an inherent property of the whole
			       ;;       delay/force paradigm.
			       ;;
			       ;;       In fact, ANY SRFI-41-like stream facility
			       ;;       in which promises are implemented as
			       ;;       closures will have the same performance
			       ;;       problems in SBCL, which is supposed to be
			       ;;       the fastest Lisp.
			       ;;
			       ;;       Better to implement the stream as a closure
			       ;;       that simply closes over the file stream,
			       ;;       and reads one element each time it's called.
			       ;;
			       ;; NOTE2: Racket's implementation of SRFI-41 streams
			       ;;        is very fast. I wonder what the difference is?
			       ;;

The above generates a DEFSTRUCT definition for SIMPLE-BINARY, along with
a definition for a READ-BINARY method and a WRITE-BINARY method.
`
The READ-BINARY method is EQL-specialized, and will construct the needed
object for you. It can be invoked like this:

    (read-binary 'simple-binary stream)

The WRITE-BINARY method is called like this:

    (write-binary object stream)

:BYTE-ORDER is either :little-endian or :big-endian to control the byte order that will
be used when reading, writing, or sending over a network. It is defined on a struct-wide
basis, and can be overridden on a per-slot basis.

:EXPORT determines whether the struct name, slot names, and generators will be exported
from the current package.

TYPES

    DEFBINARY supports two kinds of types: Ordinary Common Lisp types, and Virtual Types.

    Out of the Common Lisp types, DEFBINARY knows how to read:

        (UNSIGNED-BYTE n) and (SIGNED-BYTE n), where N is the number of bits.
        Since these types are used so frequently in DEFBINARY structs, there is a shorthand
        for them: You can simply use the number of bits as the type. Positive for unsigned,
        and negative for signed. Example:

            (defbinary foobar ()
              (x 0 :type 16)  ;; 16-bit unsigned
              (y 1 :type -16)) ;; 16-bit signed

        float, short-float, half-float, single-float, double-float, quadruple-float,
        and octuple-float.

           FLOAT SINGLE-FLOAT are treated as IEEE Single Precision,
           DOUBLE-FLOAT is treated as IEEE Double Precision, while the others are read
           in as IEEE Half Precision, Quadruple Precision, etc.

           HALF-FLOAT is stored in memory as a single-float, while floats larger than
           Double Precision are decoded into RATIONAL numbers to preserve their
           precision (they are encoded in their proper format on writing).

        (SIMPLE-ARRAY element-type (size))

            Example:

            (defbinary foobar ()
               (size 0 :type (unsigned-byte 16))
               (arr #() :type (simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (size))))

            For the element type, any real or virtual type supported by DEFBINARY is allowed.
            The SIZE is a Lisp expression that will be evaluated in an environment where all
            previous members of the struct are bound to their names.

        DEFBINARY will read and write all other CL objects using their READ-BINARY and
        WRITE-BINARY methods, if defined.

    The virtual types are:

        (COUNTED-ARRAY count-size-in-bytes element-type)

            This is a SIMPLE-ARRAY preceded by an integer specifying how many
            elements are in it. The SIMPLE-ARRAY example above could be rewritten to use
            a COUNTED-ARRAY instead, like this:

           (defbinary foobar ()
               (arr #() :type (counted-array 2 (unsigned-byte 8))))

          Obscure fact: The COUNT-SIZE-IN-BYTES does not have to be an integer. It can also be a
          fraction, which will trigger non-byte-aligned I/O. (example, if the size is 1/2, then the count
          is 4 bits wide, and the first element begins halfway into the same byte as the count) The
          ELEMENT-TYPE can also be non-byte-aligned. Doing this can result in needing to use a BIT-STREAM
          to do I/O with the struct.

          The same obscure fact applies anywhere the library accepts a size in bytes.

        (COUNTED-STRING count-size-in-bytes &key (EXTERNAL-FORMAT :latin1))
        (COUNTED-BUFFER count-size-in-bytes)

           These are like COUNTED-ARRAYS, but their elements are one byte long. Furthermore, a
           COUNTED-STRING will be encoded or decoded into a Lisp string according to its EXTERNAL-FORMAT.

           The encoding/decoding is done using the FLEXI-STREAMS library, and valid EXTERNAL-FORMATs are those
           that are accepted by FLEXI-STREAMS:OCTETS-TO-STRING.
 
           Example:

           (defbinary foobar ()
              (str \"\" :type (counted-string 2 :external-format :utf8)))

        (TERMINATED-STRING termination-length &key (terminator 0) (extenal-format :latin1))
        (TERMINATED-BUFFER termination-length &key (terminator 0))

            Specifies a C-style terminated string. The TERMINATOR is an integer that will be en/decoded
            according to the field's BYTE-ORDER. As such, it is capable of being more than one byte long,
            so it can be used to specify multi-character terminators such as CRLF.

        (FIXED-LENGTH-STRING length &key (external-format :latin1) (padding-character #\Nul))

            Specifies a string of fixed length. When writing, any excess space
            in the string will be padded with the PADDING-CHARACTER. The LENGTH is the
            number of bytes desired after encoding.

            If the input string is longer than the provided LENGTH, a condition of type
            LISP-BINARY:INPUT-STRING-TOO-LONG will be raised. Invoke the restart CL:TRUNCATE
            to trim enough excess characters from the string to make it equal to the LENGTH.

        (MAGIC &key actual-type value)

            Specifies that a magic value will be read and written. The value will be
            read as type ACTUAL-TYPE.

            If the value read is not CL:EQUAL to the VALUE given, then a condition of type
            BAD-MAGIC-VALUE will be raised.

            A BAD-MAGIC-VALUE object contains the slots BAD-VALUE and REQUIRED-VALUE.

            The error can be ignored by invoking the CL:CONTINUE restart. 

        BASE-POINTER

            Instead of reading or writing this field, CL:FILE-POSITION will be called
            on the current stream, and the address returned will be stored under a tag
            with the same name as this slot. The tag can then be used to calculate
            file positions and offsets. See the POINTER type for an example.

        FILE-POSITION

            Like BASE-POINTER, but no global tag is stored. The slot will contain the
            address in the file of the next thing to be read. No actual reading or
            writing is triggered by a slot of this type.
        
        (REGION-TAG &key base-pointer-name)

            Instead of writing the value of this slot, all POINTERs that have the same
            REGION-TAG name as this slot will be written out here, and the corresponding
            offsets will be updated. The file being written must be opened with
            :DIRECTION :IO. The POINTERs themselves will be written as offsets from
            whatever object has the BASE-POINTER named BASE-POINTER-NAME.

        (POINTER &key pointer-type data-type base-pointer-name region-tag)

            Specifies that the value is really a pointer to another value somewhere else
            in the file. When reading, if a BASE-POINTER-NAME is supplied and a base-pointer
            tag has been created, then the pointer will be treated as an offset from that
            base-pointer. If no BASE-POINTER-NAME is provided, then the pointer is treated
            as being an absolute file-position.

            The :POINTER-TYPE key specifies the type of the pointer itself, and must be some kind
            of integer.

            The :DATA-TYPE specifies the data that is being pointed to.

            The :REGION-TAG is used when writing. When WRITE-BINARY writes this field, what
            it really does is just write a zero pointer (since the object being pointed to
            proably occurs later in the file, so we don't know what the address is going to
            be yet). Then WRITE-BINARY stores the address OF THE POINTER, along with a
            serialized representation  of the data to be written.  

            When any WRITE-BINARY method gets to a REGION-TAG field, it writes out all the data
            that has been stored under that tag's name, and goes back to update the pointers.

            POINTERs cannot be automatically written if they point to an earlier part of the file
            than they themselves occur (no backwards-pointing pointers).

            Because it must go back and change what it has previously written, the stream must
            be opened with :DIRECTION :IO.

            All I/O involving POINTERs, REGION-TAGs, or BASE-POINTERs should be performed
            within a WITH-LOCAL-POINTER-RESOLVING-CONTEXT block.

            Example:

               (defbinary bar ()
                 (pointer-1 nil :type (pointer :pointer-type (unsigned-byte 16)
                                               :data-type  (terminated-string 1)
                                               :base-pointer-name foo-base
                                               :region-tag foo-region))
                 (pointer-2 0   :type (pointer :pointer-type (unsigned-byte 16)
                                               :data-type quadruple-float
                                               :base-pointer-name foo-base
                                               :region-tag foo-region)))
 

               (defbinary foo ()
                 (foo-base 0 :type base-pointer)
                 (bar nil :type bar)
                 ;; POINTER-1 and POINTER-2 will point to this:
                 (foo-region nil :type (region-tag :base-pointer-name foo-base)))
                                                    

               (with-local-pointer-resolving-context
                   (let ((input (with-open-binary-file (in \"foo.bin\")
                                   (read-binary 'foo in))))
                      (with-open-binary-file (out \"bar.bin\"
                                              :direction :io)
                          (write-binary input stream))))

        (BIT-FIELD &key raw-type member-types)

            Specifies that multiple values are to be OR'd into a single integer for serialization
            purposes. The name of a slot of this type must be specified as a list of names,
            one for each value in the bit field. :RAW-TYPE specifies the type of the single integer
            into which everything is being stored, and must meet the following requirements:

              1. Be of the form (UNSIGNED-BYTE n)
              2. Where N is divisible by 8.

            The :MEMBER-TYPES is an unevaluated list of types that must consist entirely of
            (UNSIGNED-BYTE b) or (SIGNED-BYTE b) types. The Bs must add up to N above.

            READ-BINARY will automatically separate the values in the bit field into their
            slots, and WRITE-BINARY will automatically OR them back together.
           
            The default value you specify for this field should be given as a list
            of default values for each of the subfields.

        (CUSTOM &key reader writer (lisp-type t))

            Specifies a slot of type LISP-TYPE that will be read by the provided
            READER function and written with the provided WRITER function

            The READER function must accept the lambda-list (STREAM), and its
            argument will be the stream currently being read.

            The WRITER function must accept the lambda-list (OBJECT STREAM), and
            it is generally expected to write the OBJECT to the STREAM.

            If these functions are specified as LAMBDA forms, then they will
            be closures. The READER can expect every field that has been read
            so far to be bound to their names, while the WRITER can expect
            to be able to see all the slots in the struct being written.

            Both functions are optional.

        NULL

            Reading and writing will be a no-op. The value of a field of type NULL will always read
            as NIL and be ignored when writing.

RUNTIME TYPE DETERMINATION 

    (EVAL unquoted-type-expression)

    The EVAL type specifier causes the type to be computed at runtime. The UNQUOTED-TYPE-EXPRESSION will be
    evaluated just before attempting to read the field of this type in an environment where all the
    previously-defined fields are bound to their names.

    Example:

        (defbinary foobar ()
           (type-tag 0 :type (unsigned-byte 32))
           (data nil :type (eval (case type-tag
                                       (1 '(unsigned-byte 16))
                                       (2 '(counted-string 1 :external-format :utf-8))))))

   In the above example, READ-BINARY will first read the TYPE-TAG as an (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32),
   then it will evaluate the CASE expression in order to get the type of the DATA. Then it
   will generate a reader and a writer the same way DEFBINARY normally does, except at runtime
   instead of compile time.

   The CASE expression is not actually evaluated with a runtime call to EVAL. Instead, it is
   embedded directly in the source code of the generated READ-BINARY and WRITE-BINARY methods.

   The reader/writer code derived from the resulting type expression, however, *is* evaluated with
   a runtime call to EVAL, and the part of the macroexpander that handles type fields gets called
   at runtime as well.

   If the UNQUOTED-TYPE-EXPRESSION evaluates to another EVAL type specifier, then that specifier
   will be expanded once again. 

DEFINING STRINGS

    :EXTERNAL-FORMAT is any value accepted by flexi-streams:octets-to-string, such as :latin1 or :utf8.

    String count and terminated-buffer terminator lengths are given in BYTES, unlike the
    Common Lisp type '(unsigned-byte n)' in which the length is given in bits.

    The types COUNTED-STRING and COUNTED-BUFFER are virtual types. When encountered, DEFBINARY will
    generate code that deals with counted strings and buffers, which are blocks of data that begin
    with a size. The number passed with this type is the size of the count. The difference between the
    two is that one of them is converted to and from a STRING while the other retains its raw binary
    representation and will be a SIMPLE-ARRAY of (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8).

    (TERMINATED-STRING terminator-size) and (TERMINATED-BUFFER terminator-size) are for blocks of data that end with a
    terminator of some kind. The terminator is not produced as part of the buffer. The terminator-size defaults to 1.

    All generated buffers and strings are guaranteed to have the type SIMPLE-ARRAY.

ARRAYS OF COMPLEX TYPES

    In the (SIMPLE-ARRAY element-type length) type specifier, the LENGTH is evaluated when the array is being read.
    Previously defined fields will be bound. The ELEMENT-TYPE can be any type supported by DEFBINARY, including
    the EVAL type specifier and the COUNTED-STRING, COUNTED-BUFFER, TERMINATED-STRING, and TERMINATED-BUFFER virtual
    types. Notably, ELEMENT-TYPE can be other types that were previously defined with DEFBINARY.

    There is also the type (COUNTED-ARRAY count-size element-type), which functions like COUNTED-STRING or COUNTED-BUFFER,
    except that each element of the array can be a complex type.

NON-BYTE-ALIGNED I/O: AN ALTERNATIVE TO BIT FIELDS

          DEFBINARY supports non-byte-aligned reads. For example, if you want to read a 4-bit
          unsigned integer and a 12-bit signed integer:

            (defbinary non-conforming (:byte-order :big-endian)
              (x 0 :type 4) 
              (y 0 :type 12)) ;; Total: 16 bits.

          The above will compile to a single 16-bit read, and the two values will be automatically
          extracted into their respective fields. The reverse operation is generated for writing.

          In fact, the above is converted into a BIT-FIELD declaration, so it is exactly equivalent
          to the following:

            (defbinary non-conforming-bit-field-version (:byte-order :big-endian)
              ((x y) 0 :type (bit-field :raw-type (unsigned-byte 16)
                                        :member-types ((unsigned-byte 4)
                                                       (unsigned-byte 12)))))

          The macro will group sets signed or unsigned bytes to achieve a read that consists of
          whole bytes. This grouping mechanism only works for SIGNED-BYTE and UNSIGNED-BYTE integers.

          For other types, DEFBINARY will generate a temporary BIT-STREAM for the non-byte-aligned parts:

             (defbinary non-byte-aligned-string (:byte-order :big-endian)
               (x 0 :type 4)
               (string \"\" :type (counted-string 1))
               (y 0 :type 4))
             ;; End of non-byte-aligned part
               (z \"\" :type (counted-string 1)))

          As long as the sum of the bits adds up to a whole number of bytes, no
          special handling is required on the part of the programmer. Internally,
          the above generates a temporary bit-stream and reads from it, and it discards
          the bit-stream before reading Z, because Z doesn't require non-byte-aligned I/O.
          This is slower than doing whole-byte reads.

          Finally, you can specify bytes that throw off the byte-alignment of the
          stream:

              (defbinary stays-non-byte-aligned ()
                 (x 0 :type 3))

          If the macro cannot group the fields in the struct into byte-aligned reads,
          then the struct can only be read from a BIT-STREAM and not a normal
          stream (see WRAP-IN-BIT-STREAM and WITH-WRAPPED-IN-BIT-STREAM). In this
          case, the macro will generate READ-BINARY and WRITE-BINARY methods that
          are specialized to a second argument of type BIT-STREAM.

          BIT-STREAMs can wrap any type of stream, including other BIT-STREAMs. This
          means that you can nest one struct that does BIT-STREAM I/O inside another:

             (defbinary stays-non-byte-aligned ()
                (x 0 :type 3)
                (y nil :type non-byte-aligned-string)) ;; See above


NON-BYTE-ALIGNED FIELDS and LITTLE ENDIANNESS

  Bit fields are inherently confusing when they are applied to little-endian data (unlike
  big-endian data, where they make perfect sense). This is because programmers who write
  specifications for little-endian formats sometimes still describe the bit fields by
  starting with the most significant bit.

  Also, code that handles bit fields from little endian data may also handle that data
  starting with the most significant bit (including some byte-order-independent code in
  this library).

  The BIT-FIELD type in DEFBINARY adds to this confusion, since the fields must always
  be given starting with the most significant bit, regardless of the format's byte order.

  However, when specifying non-byte-aligned fields without using BIT-FIELDs, they must be
  specified starting with the LEAST significant bit in a LITTLE-ENDIAN format, but they
  must be specified starting with the MOST significant bit in a BIG-ENDIAN format. For
  example, consider the following toy format:

     (defbinary toy-format (:byte-order :little-endian)
       (a 0 :type 4)
       (b 0 :type 16)
       (c 0 :type 4))

  Write it to disk with the following code:

     (with-open-binary-file (out #P\"/tmp/test-1.bin\" :direction :output
 					 :if-exists :supersede
					 :if-does-not-exist :create)
	       (write-binary (make-toy-format :a #x1 :b #x2345 :c #x6) out))

  The resulting file would produce the following confusing hex dump:

    51 34 62

  What is that 5 from the middle doing at the very beginning?!?! Since 0x5 is
  the second-least-significant nibble in the structure, it appears in the
  most significant nibble of the least significant byte. 

  Reading the above as a little-endian, 24-bit unsigned integer gives the
  integer #x623451, which is what you should have been expecting, since
  C is the most significant field, and its value is 6.

  You can also specify the above format using the BIT-FIELD type. But then you
  have to account for the fact that in a BIT-FIELD type description, you always
  describe the most significant bits first, no matter what. So the variables
  and their corresponding types have to be reversed:

     (defbinary toy-format/bit-field (:byte-order :little-endian)
       ((c b a) nil :type (bit-field :raw-type (unsigned-byte 24)
                                     :member-types ((unsigned-byte 4)
                                                    (unsigned-byte 16)
                                                    (unsigned-byte 4)))))


ALIGNMENT

  DEFBINARY can generate aligned structures. Alignment is calculated as an offset from the beginning of the structure
  being defined. If a SIMPLE-ARRAY is defined with :ALIGN-ELEMENT {boundary}, then each element will be aligned to that
  boundary. On writes, the alignment is achieved by writing NUL (0) bytes. On reads, the alignment is performed by
  reading bytes from the stream one at a time. Alignment is always performed before reading and writing, never after.

MANUAL ALIGNMENT

    If the &KEY argument :BYTE-COUNT-NAME is specified, then the name given will be bound as a variable whose value is the number of bytes read or
    written so far. This binding is visible in forms that are evaluated at runtime, such as array-length specifiers and EVAL type
    specifiers. 

FLOATING-POINT NUMBERS

   DEFBINARY can read IEEE floats ranging from half-precision up to octuple precision. Double-precision and below are
   represented in memory by hardware floats, while larger-precision floats are decoded into RATIONALs.

   Furthermore, single and double-precision floats are decoded from their byte representation by using CFFI, which
   lets the hardware do the work on those systems that have FPUs (such as x86/AMD machines).

   All other types of floating-point number are encoded and decoded using arithmetic.
